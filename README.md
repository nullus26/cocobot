##A Discord bot for a Discord challenge, fitting isn't it?
Responds to certain commands and keeps track of a chain of messages. The record for the longest message chain is stored in a record.txt file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create the bot by going to https://discord.com/developers/applications and creating a new app.
2. Get a bot token by pressing 'reset token' in the bot tab and copy the token
3. Scroll down and go to 'Privileged Gateway Intents'. Check the 3 permissions which are turned off by default.
4. Invite the bot to the server by going to "OAuth2", and then going to "URL Generator". In here, check the option that says bot, and copy the link it has just generated.
5. now that the bot is created and has been invited to the server, we only need to fill in the code with the generated token and run the program. (NOTE: the script must always be running in a computer for the bot to work)

Enjoy getting your chains broken by random people in your server!!!
